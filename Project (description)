In this project, I worked on a basic data visualization task using Microsoft Excel.
The primary objective was to organize the given dataset and create a Column Chart to visually represent the information clearly and effectively.

What I did:
Organized the raw data into a structured table format.
Selected relevant data points to be included in the chart.
Created a 2D Column Chart based on the provided data.
Customized the chart to enhance readability:
Added proper axis labels.
Used clear titles for better understanding.
Applied basic formatting to make the chart visually appealing.
Ensured that the final output is clean, professional, and presentation-ready.

Purpose:
This project showcases basic data handling and visualization skills using Excel — an essential step for effective data storytelling and reporting.
